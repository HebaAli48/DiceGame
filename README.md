# Dice Game

Welcome to the Dice Game! This is a simple web-based two-player game where players take turns rolling a dice and accumulate scores to win.

## Game Rules

- The game has 2 players who take turns.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each roll's result gets added to the player's current round score.
- However, if the player rolls a 1, all their current round score is lost, and it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which adds their current round score to their global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 50 points in the global score wins the game.
